  // Since your template can't hold any JS logic, we need to execute the logic here.
  // The result is added to the object as a new property, which can then be referenced by key in the template.
  // For example, you might want to display how old a post is, or say "(draft)" if it has no publication date:
  this.daysAgo = parseInt((new Date() - new Date(this.publishedOn))/60/60/24/1000);

// COMMENT: Why are there parentheses around "(a,b)" in the .sort() method, but not around the "articleObject" or "article" arguments in the .forEach() methods?
// In the .sort we are looking at 2 parameters (a,b), which are short for publishedOn. Making it easier to not have to look for it in the function below.
rawData.sort((a,b) => {
  return (new Date(b.publishedOn)) - (new Date(a.publishedOn));
